# 🌐 Landing Page Project

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Foundation curriculum**, where I created a landing page based on a provided design. The goal of this project was to practice building a complete web page using **HTML** and **CSS**, while following the design layout as closely as possible.

## 🌟 Features

- A fully responsive landing page based on a design mockup.
- 4 main sections: hero section, features section, call-to-action, and a footer.
- Clean layout with fonts, colors, and content based on the design template.
- Basic flexbox layout to structure the sections on the page.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page and layout.
- **Flexbox**: For responsive layout and element alignment.
